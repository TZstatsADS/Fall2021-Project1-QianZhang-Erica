### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: What materials should I choose for my report?
+ This project is conducted by [Qian Zhang]

+ Project summary: [This is a report about choosing proper materials for me to write my other report. By given dataset, I apply a sentiment analysis and a keyword extraction to find the percentage of positive, negative and neutral attitudes and the keywords in texts for every school. By these results, I am able to find which material talks about my topic and supports my arguments.]
